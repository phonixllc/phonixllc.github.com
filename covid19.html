We went through the trouble of finding these resources so you don't have to. Maybe you will learn some new ways of how to respond to Co-Vid 19.

          <p class="buy">The Band Famous (TBF) is a husband/wife collaborative duo – Jacob Alexander Figueroa (Zander) and Mary Norell Jackson (Norell) make and run the band, the software - The Band Famous website and apps on the iPhone App Store / Android Google Play Store - and the private venue in Los Angeles, CA where they lead the movement with their “Party for a Purpose” themed Benefit Music Festivals and Events helping charities and featuring musicians from the Hall Of Fame, a music collective TBF grows and hard-codes into their website.</p> <p class="buy">The Band Famous brings everyone together for a weekend of multi-sensory events that leave guests feeling the love and inspiration for days, weeks, months, and ideally years to come.</p>
          <p class="buy">People who have attended our events have expressed regret for not being able to make one of our events sooner, and they have expressed joy and inspiration they are left feeling following the whole creative experience.</p>
          <p class="buy">We combine art, body painting, music, comedy, DJs and more elements for well-rounded, interactive experiences, some of the proceeds of which go to various causes and charities. Past benefit shows and festivals have aided LA Food Bank, American Heart Association, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and My Friend’s Place.</p>
          <br>
          <div class="meta"><h2>The Movement</h2> </div>
          <p class="buy">Zander and Norell make the music group The Band Famous® aka TBF.
          They are the first band in the world to release a debut musical album, Last Words, of improvisation in the form of an interactive app, built by the band members' themselves.</p>
          <p class="buy">
          After making The Band Famous, they took it a step further and implemented the Hall Of Fame on their website, a growing online music collective spanning multiple genres of original music, along with TBF Radio, where one may hear samples from featured artists in the HOF all without commercials or login required.</p>
          <p class="buy">
