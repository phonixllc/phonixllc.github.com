            <b><u><h3 style="margin-top:-10px;">Surveys:</h3></u></b>

            <p>The following are some options which offer some compensation for simple things like taking surveys, and shopping online. Read on to learn about rewards you can earn when you <em>spend</em> money as well.</p>


            <p><a href="https://swagbucks.com" target="_blank">Swagbucks</a> offers coupons and cash-back when you shop online, and you can also accumulate earnings through their surveys.</p>

            <p><a href="https://surveyjunkie.com" target="_blank">SurveyJunkie.com</a> offers points for completing online surveys. Every 362 points you accumulate equate to $5.00 USD.</p>

            <p><a href="https://lifepointspanel.com" target="_blank">Lifepointspanel.com</a> offers payments in the form of gift cards or PayPal for completing enough of their surveys. Your views and opinions help influence brands you know and love.</p>

            <p><a href="https://inboxdollars.com" target="_blank">Inboxdollars.com</a> will also pay you money to take surveys, as well as reading emails, playing games, watching videos and more. They'll give you $5.00 just for getting started! You will also have the opportunity to earn money back when you spend money online. You can cash out at the $30 mark.</p>

            <p><a href="https://prizerebel.com" target="_blank">Prizerebel.com</a> has a point system where every 500 points equal $5.00; 1000 points = $10.00, and so on. They are similar to InboxDollars and Swagbucks by presenting several methods of earning supplemental side income.</p> 

            <p>With all of these "get paid to take surveys", etc., beware of third-party promotions and we highly advise caution in downloading <em>anything</em>. We also recommend only earning extra money in this fashion if you have a good anti-malware installed, as some third-parties can be spammy. Also, don't overshare and consider using an email for surveys alone (they have a tendency to flood your inbox with survey opportunities).</p>
