    <p class="fancy">We love to game and make music when we aren't tending to the many animals in our care. We live off grid, which poses its challenges, but we're resourceful and have built many coops with recycled materials. We're powered by the sun with solar power, which is what enables us to stay connected to all of you! And it allows us to work on no man's land where we care for chickens, ducks, rabbits, turtles, dogs, cats, and more in the high desert. We have rescued, fostered and re-homed many animals, and provide sanctuary to many more.</p>
